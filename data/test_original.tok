No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is  identified.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.    IMPRESSION:  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with intubation.    No prior examinations for comparison.    CHEST, AP:  Endotracheal tube terminates 6 cm from the carina.  Nasogastric  tube loops within the stomach, with side port within the gastric body.  There  are no significant pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Mild retrocardiac  atelectasis is present.  Heart size is normal.  The aorta is tortuous.    IMPRESSION:  ET and NG tubes in standard position.
PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___     COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.    CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with dyspnea and hypoxia, question acute  intrathoracic process.    FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright view of the chest provided.  Midline sternotomy  wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  There are lower lung opacities  which is potential concern for pneumonia.  There is no large effusion or  pneumothorax.  Mild central hilar congestion is somewhat improved from prior  exam.  The heart size is top normal.  The mediastinal contour is unchanged.   No definite signs of pneumothorax.  Bony structures appear grossly intact.    IMPRESSION:  Lower lung opacities which could represent atelectasis versus  pneumonia.  Possible mild congestion.
INDICATION:  Evaluate possible right lower lobe pneumonia.    COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.    FINDINGS:  The previously seen right lower lobe opacification has decreased  substantially.  There has also been a mild decrease in the amount of vascular  engorgement suggesting improvement in mild biventricular heart failure.  In  retrospect, given the rapid change, the opacification likely represented fluid  overload.  The heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  The sternal wires  are intact and midline.  There is longstanding midline lucency in the  manubrium and upper body is due to incomplete sternal fusion; there is no  evidence of other incision complications. A PICC can be traced to the mid SVC.    IMPRESSION:  1.  Mild improvement of pulmonary vascular congestion.  2.  Less opacification at the right lower; no evidence of pneumonia on today's  radiograph.    Results were communicated with the surgery team by Dr. ___.
EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)    INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with h/o small cell lung cancer s/p radiation  and severe emphysema presenting with dyspena, treating for COPD exacerbation,  CXR on admission with ?fluid in the right major fissure.  // Evaluate for  interval change, particularly of the right major fissue and note of fluid on  prior CXR.    TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright chest radiograph    COMPARISON:  ___    FINDINGS:     Since the prior study the pseudotumor (fluid in the major fissure) on the  right has resolved.  Post treatment changes including elevation of the right  hilus and coarse interstitial changes indicative of radiation fibrosis are  again noted, a chronic finding.  Obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm is  likely a function of atelectasis and a small pleural effusion.  The left lung  is largely clear.  Heart size and mediastinal contours are stable.  Heavily  calcified aortic arch is again noted.    IMPRESSION:     1.  Resolution of fluid in the right major fissure.  2.  Small right pleural effusion and right basilar atelectasis.  3.  Chronic treatment-related changes in the right lung.
TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.    INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with end-stage renal disease, status  post renal allograft, who presented with flash pulmonary edema.

COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.    FINDINGS:  There is a decreased though persistent right-sided  hydropneumothorax with interval incomplete reexpansion of the right lung.  No  significant mediastinal shift identified with unremarkable mediastinal, hilar,  and cardiac contours.  Right lower lung opacifications may reflect combination  of reexpansion edema and atelectasis. Minimal left lung atelectasis noted.    IMPRESSION:  Improving right hydropneumothorax with right lower lung  opacifications, atelectasis versus edema are likely.
EXAMINATION:  Chest:  Frontal and lateral views    INDICATION:  ___M w/sob  // ___M w/sob    TECHNIQUE:  Chest:  Frontal and Lateral    COMPARISON:  ___    FINDINGS:     There are low lung volumes.  Again seen bilateral loculated pleural effusions  and right base opacity which may be due to atelectasis.  There is persistent  elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes  are grossly stable.  Patient is status post median sternotomy with the  superior two most wires again seen to be fractured/ deshiscence.    IMPRESSION:     Again seen bilateral loculated pleural effusions and right base opacity which  may be due to atelectasis.  Persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
PORTABLE CHEST:  ___    HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with hypertension, rule out infectious process.    FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from  ___.  When compared to prior, there has been significant interval  enlargement of bilateral pleural effusions which are now moderate in size.   Underlying airspace disease is also possible.  Superiorly, however, the lungs  are grossly clear.  Cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess given the size  of effusions.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are unchanged.    IMPRESSION:  Significant interval increase in the bilateral pleural effusions  since prior exam with possible underlying airspace disease not excluded.
EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)    INDICATION:  History: ___F with PICC needs placement confirmed.    TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest radiograph    COMPARISON:  ___    FINDINGS:     Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Pacer leads are in stable position.   Hemodialysis catheter terminates in the right atrium, unchanged.  The lungs  are essentially clear, and the right lung base is partially obscured by the  overlying pacemaker generator. Prosthetic valves and sternal wires are  unchanged. Blunting of left costophrenic angle likely indicates a small  pleural effusion.    IMPRESSION:     1.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly and a likely small left pleural effusion.  2. Hemodialysis catheter terminating in the right atrium.
CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___    COMPARISON:  ___.    CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fatigue.  Assess for pneumonia.    FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Midline  sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  The lungs appear  clear bilaterally without definite signs of pneumonia or CHF.  The patient is  known to have multiple pulmonary metastases which are not well seen.  A lesion  in the left lower lobe projects over the posterior margin of the heart on the  lateral view.  A nodular opacity is again noted in the left upper lobe.  No  pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart size is stable.  Mediastinal contour  is also stable.  Bony structures appear intact.

Left chest wall dual lumen central venous  catheter has been removed.  There is a left brachiocephalic/superior vena cava  stent.  The lungs are clear of consolidation or pulmonary vascular congestion.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged likely exaggerated due to technique and  positioning.  Multiple posterior healed right rib fractures are identified.    IMPRESSION:    No acute cardiopulmonary process.
INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post thoracotomy and left lower lobe  lobectomy, now requiring assessment for interval change.    COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___,  ___, ___, and ___.    FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest demonstrate interval worsening  of left lung opacity.  The entire left hemithorax is now again opacified.   Opacification is likely due to a large left pleural fluid collection in the  setting of lobectomy versus less likely left lung collapse.  There is  persistent significant elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  The right lung is  clear.  There is no right pleural effusion.  Cardiac size cannot be assessed  due to obscuration by the left hemithorax opacification.  The mediastinum is  not shifted.    IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in the opacification of left hemithorax, likely  consistent with large left pleural effusion.  Right lung is clear.
CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with three days of worsening right  shoulder pain.  No chest or abdominal pain.    COMPARISON: CXR ___ and CT ___    FINDINGS:  Frontal AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The  patient is rotated.

A  vascular stent, presumably within the right brachiocephalic vein, again  projects over the medial right lung apex.    IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with likely pneumonia at outside hospital.    COMPARISON:  ___.    FINDINGS:    Single AP view of the chest.  Postoperative changes again seen in the right  thoracic cavity.  Compared to prior, there appears to be less aerated lung on  the right which could be due to enlarging effusion with possible underlying  parenchymal abnormality.  In addition, there is persistent left basilar  opacity not significantly changed given differences in technique.  Superiorly,  the left lung remains clear.  Right PICC and right pleural catheter are again  noted.    IMPRESSION:    1.  Persistent left basilar opacity, compared to ___.  This could  represent atelectasis although infection is not excluded.      2.  Less aerated lung on the right when compared to prior, potentially due to  collecting pleural fluid although developing parenchymal abnormalities are  also possible.
INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with cough, to rule out infection.    COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___ and a CT torso with contrast  ___.    PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours  are normal.  In comparison to the prior study, a nodular opacity in the right  upper lobe measuring approximately 13 mm, is new.  The left lung appears  relatively clear.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax  is seen.  No acute osseous abnormality is detected.  Surgical clips are seen  in the left paraspinal region in the abdomen, consistent with prior  nephrectomy.    IMPRESSION:  New nodular opacity in the right upper lobe, concerning for  metastatic disease, less likely infection in this patient with known history  of RCC.  A chest CT is recommended for further evaluation.
HISTORY:  Portions and exertion x.    TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral views of the chest.    COMPARISON:  ___.    FINDINGS:    Dual lead left-sided pacemaker is again seen extending to the expected  positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.  No focal consolidation is  seen.  There is slight blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles which may  be due to very trace pleural effusions.  There is slight prominence of the  interstitium which may be due to minimal interstitial edema.  The cardiac and  mediastinal silhouettes are stable. Right proximal humerus hardware is seen  but not well evaluated.    IMPRESSION:    Possible trace pleural effusions and minimal interstitial edema.
EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph    INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypotension of unknown origin  // rule out  pna or pneumonitis    TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest    COMPARISON:  AP view of the chest from ___ at 10:53 AM    FINDINGS:     No significant change within the airspace opacity at the left mid lung zone.

HISTORY:  Hypoxia.    TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.    COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CT ___     FINDINGS:    Low lung volumes are again demonstrated.  Chronic interstitial abnormality is  again seen as well as more focal opacities within the left lung base, left  perihilar region, and right upper lobe which are not significantly changed  when compared to the prior exam.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours  are relatively unchanged with marked calcification of the aortic knob.  No  pneumothorax or large pleural effusion is demonstrated.  The right PICC has  been removed.  Assessment of the pulmonary vascularity is limited.    IMPRESSION:    Relatively unchanged appearance of the chest compared to prior exam.  Persistent opacities within the right upper lobe, left lung base and left  perihilar region are redemonstrated on a background of chronic interstitial  lung disease which on the prior chest CT was thought to reflect UIP or  fibrosing NSIP.  As before, these more focal opacities may reflect progression  of chronic interstitial lung disease, acute exacerbation of interstitial lung  disease, or possibly infection.

There is a stable small left pleural effusion and likely a small residual  right pleural effusion.  Scattered bilateral opacities are otherwise  unchanged, likely reflective of the known multifocal pneumonia.    Results were discussed with Dr. ___ (___ resident) at 5:10 p.m.  on ___ via telephone by Dr. ___ at the time the findings were discovered.
INDICATION:  Chest pressure.  Assess for infiltrate.    TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.    COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.    FINDINGS:  Low lung volumes are seen which limit assessment.  There is a an  opacity, which obscures the right heart border, concerning for an early  developing right middle lobe pneumonia.

CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___     COMPARISON:  ___    CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old with dyspnea.    FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Midline  sternotomy wires are again noted.  Patient is rotated somewhat limiting the  evaluation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, though cardiomediastinal  silhouette appears grossly stable.  There are small layering bilateral  effusions with mild interstitial edema.  Overall, there has been no  significant change from prior study.  Bony structures are intact.    IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial edema, stable cardiomegaly with small bilateral  effusions.
TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.    INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with recent history of right pleural  effusion, status post thoracocentesis x2, assess for interval change.    FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright  position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable AP single view  chest examination of ___.  The patient is now examined in  standing upright position.  There is status post sternotomy and significant  cardiac enlargement as before.  Within the cardiac shadow, metallic portions  of three different valve prostheses can be identified.  One is a circular  metallic ring in the position of the aortic valve, the second one a similar  oval-shaped ring formation in the mitral valve position, and the third one an  open circle rather typical for a tricuspid valve annuloplasty.  Correlating  the position of these valves to the outer contours of the heart, one can state  that there is remaining marked enlargement of the left atrium, but the  increased distance between the tricuspid valvuloplasty and the anterior heart  border speaks much in favor of a right ventricular enlargement as well as an  enlarged right atrium.  Prominence of the ascending aortic contour is  moderate.  The pulmonary vasculature is presently not congested, and on  previous portable examination identified edema pattern as well as evidence of  right-sided pleural effusion has normalized.  No new parenchymal abnormalities  are seen, and no pneumothorax is identified in the apical area.  Again  observed is a fractured second rib in the left apical area, apparently the  result of previous sternotomy and intrathoracic cardiac intervention.  When  comparison is extended to the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination  of ___, the patient is in better condition now as the cardiac  enlargement has regressed and the pleural effusion has been absorbed  completely.    IMPRESSION:  Marked improvement of CHF in patient with history of triple valve  replacement.

FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in  supine position.  Comparison is made with a previous similar examination of  ___, which also was performed with the patient in supine position.   Moderate cardiac enlargement as before.  Heart size may have increased  slightly.  However, portable technique in supine position does not allow  precise assessment.  Comparison with the next previous study clearly  identifies a new parenchymal density in the left hemithorax in perihilar  position extending into the left upper lobe.  The previously identified left  lower lobe linear densities suspicious for atelectasis persist.  No new  pulmonary abnormalities in the right hemithorax and no pneumothorax identified  on either side.  The patient is intubated and the ETT terminates in the  trachea some 5 cm above the level of the carina.    IMPRESSION:  New parenchymal infiltrates in mid and left upper lung field.

TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP and lateral    COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___ and ___.  CT chest  of ___.    FINDINGS:     Lung volumes continue to be low.  Bilateral loculated pleural effusions are  again seen and grossly unchanged.  A right basilar opacity may be due to  atelectasis, but there is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.   Compared with the prior study, increased interstitial lung markings suggest  the presence of mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Patient is post CABG with  wondering median sternotomy wires, consistent with known chronic sternal  dehiscence.    IMPRESSION:     1.  Compared with the prior study, there is worsened interstitial pulmonary  edema.    2.  Grossly unchanged bilateral loculated pleural effusions.

AP SEMI-ERECT PORTABLE CHEST, ___ AT ___ HOURS.    HISTORY:  Pneumothorax post chest tube placement.    COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated ___.  Please  note the patient also had a chest CT earlier same day.    FINDINGS:  Consistent with the given history, a chest tube is noted and is  directed medially in the upper mediastinum with a location that is highly  suggestive of intrafissural placement.  There is increased lucency at the lung  base, particularly outlining the right hemidiaphragm, which likely indicates a  residual component of the pneumothorax.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary nodules  consistent with widespread metastatic disease are again present.  There is air  noted around a ray cage device in the lower thoracic spine, surrounded by  posterior spinal stabilization rods.  Extensive surgical clips are noted  within the medial left upper quadrant.  It is difficult to discern the left  hemidiaphragm.  There is increased retrocardiac opacity, although similar to  the prior exam.  A Port-A-Cath is evident in stable and standard course and  position.  The osseous structures are difficult to assess, but are grossly  stable.    IMPRESSION:  The course of the chest tube projecting over the right chest  suggests an intrafissural position, which may limit the ability to evacuate  the pneumothorax.
